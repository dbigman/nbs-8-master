# Project Management with JIRA

## Introduction

In this exercise, we will learn the basics of JIRA, a tool used for project management and agile workflows. Throughout this activity, we will gain practical experience in creating a project, building a backlog, and conducting sprint meetingsâ€”all essential skills for effectively managing projects in JIRA.

## Context

As a group, you are a development team responsible for building a dashboard for a store's sales. Within the team, there are various roles, such as the Product Owner, who is responsible for the product; the SCRUM Master, who is responsible for the team and ensuring that everything is delivered on time; and the developers, who are responsible for executing the tasks and estimating how long each task will take.

## Activity

Let's simulate a situation where the development of this dashboard needs to be managed:

### Step 0: Create a JIRA Account

### Step 1: Create a Project in JIRA

1. Create a Project

2. Log in to JIRA and create a new project. Please select:
   1. The "Scrum" template under "Software Development"
   2. Choose "Team Managed Project"
   3. Give a name to the project
3. It's sufficient for only one participant to create the project and share the screen with everyone else, but if you wish, you can "share" the project so that everyone can see it simultaneously.

### Add the following User Stories and tasks to your backlog:
#### User Stories
1. As a user, I want to log in with Google securely so that I can access my personal dashboard.
2. As an administrator, I want to manage user roles to control access levels.
3. As a user, I want to view 3 bar charts of my revenues, costs, and profits to track my financial performance.

#### Tasks

1. Develop the Revenue chart.
2. Develop the Profit chart.
3. Develop the Cost chart.
4. Design the login page.
5. Create the user role management functionality.
6. Implement the activity report generation.

> **Note:** Please add more User Stories and tasks to expand the scope of the project.

### Step 2: First Sprint Meeting

1. After the Backlog is fully populated...
2. Assign Roles
3. Divide the group into the following roles:
   1. **Product Owner:** Responsible for defining the product vision, prioritizing the backlog, and ensuring the project meets the customer's needs.
   2. **Scrum Master / Team Leader:** Facilitates the sprint meeting, removes impediments, and ensures the team follows agile practices.
   3. **Developers:** Responsible for estimating, implementing, and completing tasks during the sprint.
4. Conduct the Sprint Meeting
5. Discuss the following aspects:
   1. **Identify Important Features:** Discuss which features are most important for the next sprint.
   2. **Estimate Story Points:** Estimate how many Story Points each task or feature will take.
   3. **Identify Dependencies:** Determine if there are dependencies between tasks that need to be considered.

> **Note:** This meeting is essential to ensure everyone is aligned and that the team understands the sprint objectives.

### Step 3: Create and Start a Sprint

1. Create a Sprint
2. In JIRA, create a new sprint by selecting the tasks and User Stories you want to include in this iteration.
3. Start the Sprint
4. Once the sprint is created, start it to begin tracking the progress of the selected tasks.
5. Check the Sprint Board
6. Navigate to the Sprint Board in JIRA. This is where developers will manage tasks throughout the sprint.
7. Move tasks from **To Do** to **In Progress** and finally to **Done** as work is completed.

> **Note:** Use the Active Sprints Board to monitor progress and ensure everyone is clear about their responsibilities during the sprint. When finished, feel free to explore other areas of JIRA: reports, Confluence pages, or Releases.

### Sprint Duration

Upon completing a Sprint and deploying our dashboard, we will be able to obtain new information: bugs that are occurring, feedback on dashboard features, or even new objectives that the dashboard should achieve...

### Final Step

New information about the dashboard will be provided soon. When you finish the exercise, you can return to the main room.
